TO DO (Priority High --> Low):
	-PWM ISR
	-ACK Protocol
	-Transmitting state logic
	-Ethernet/Serial ISR
	-Scheduler.txt (data_array order) (could be in ALinkProtocal.h)
	-Signal Threshold Calculations (based on tests with transducers)


Problems:
	-DMA with ADC?
	-

Work in Progress:
	-CRC8
	-


Completed:
	-processing routine for recieved bits from ADC
	-main loop sampling routine
	-logic to process + behave with different messages
	
	
Goal:
	-get RX and TX working
	-get two wire comm to work between the two boards.
	-test comm with transducers next
